In these folders you can find multiple useful scripts for designing the EFlesh custom mesh, the .ino files corresponding to ArduinoIDE upload to the openCM9.04 board and the python scripts to execute in the main device.

While attempting to generate the EFlesh mesh to a custom solid body with a file extension .stl or .obj, make sure to follow the steps listed in the official EFlesh repo:
